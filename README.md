## Talk-in Station for W0YC at the Minnesota State Fair 2022
It was a success! We took turns between Matt, K0LTC, Eric and Matt N0YNT doing 'talk-in' for the MN State Fair. We got lots of ears asking about the talkin station and lots of folks checking in from the fair themselves!

444.425 Minneapolis was preferred, despite the many systems we have overlooking the fair. All stations into Minneapolis had strong singals, and it worked great!

See you in 2023!

# Conversation leading up to MN Fair 2022:
Matt K0LTC says:

>The comment on the net tonight about designating repeaters/simplex frequencies to the State Fair for those attending is great. I think we could promote it and see what kind of traction we can get. 

>Would you be willing to have your machines either at the STP campus or 444.425 be the designated analog system? I'm guessing the 444.425 could handle HT traffic there and has a massive footprint for people to tune in and listen to the state fair activity, but you have those other machines right next door!

>And... for DMR what do you think the best machine/talkgroup would be that most people regardless of network would be able to access? 

>I think it's a fabulous idea to try and start this tradition, just need your support and thoughts! :) 

Matt N0YNT says:

>Yes, the correct frequency of the St. Paul W0YC/R is 442.425, 114.8hz. It's also a mix-mode P25 capable system. See repeaterbook.com or https://github.com/mgenelins/w0yc-repeaters for details.

>I think we could even have a talk-in station for each day of the fair on the air as 'W0YC'. That way you could get traffic, directions, events and such that are taking place at the fair. And a "Net Control Talk In" could monitor traffic on the air for needed help from familities, locating booths and other hams on the air!

>Wanna join in and take a shift as "Talk-in Net Control"?


Ben Franske says:

>I love the idea of W0YC hosting an official fair repeater. There are undoubtedly many hams who go to the fair and many who bring along a radio. I know I almost always do, but without a publicized central repeater it's hard to find other hams who are there. Ideally there would be a way to partner with the fair and get some promotion (maybe someone like the U would even be willing to give up some demo space for on site ham radio demonstrations at least one day if we could find people to staff it) including putting it on their website or something. I think it's far too close to the fair to arrange much official this year but maybe we consider it a trial.

>It would be super awesome to have some information available on talk-in about the availability of parking spots at the free park and ride locations, not sure how we would collect that though except unofficially by having net control ask people who are parking to report in on parking availability and keep a log of what time we had the latest information about spots at various lots. This gets periodically posted to twitter by the fair too but it's pretty sporadic posting of availability.
